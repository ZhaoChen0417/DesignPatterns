### 在JDK中，java.lang.Runtime就是经典的单例模式(饿汉式)

```java
public class Runtime {
    private static final Runtime currentRuntime = new Runtime();

    private static Version version;

    /**
     * Returns the runtime object associated with the current Java application.
     * Most of the methods of class {@code Runtime} are instance
     * methods and must be invoked with respect to the current runtime object.
     *
     * @return  the {@code Runtime} object associated with the current
     *          Java application.
     */
    public static Runtime getRuntime() {
        return currentRuntime;
    }

    /** Don't let anyone else instantiate this class */
    private Runtime() {}
```
